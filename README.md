# Thank you once again for checking out my website :D. This is my first ever webpage hosted by GitHub.

# My project consist a little personal information about me, things such us my education, reason for wanting to learn to program,
  skills, interests, and hobbies, as well as links that will redirect you to other HTML projects that I myself have worked on.

# This project was created by use of HTML and CSS, in which both languages were edited by Sublime 3. Git commands were also used through commandline to
  make changes and publish to the online repository.	

# Accessing the website is easy, simply open this link. https://cmd33prompt.github.io/IP1/
